a) The b32 vector(vec32 num) should be a vector of __m512*. This will avoid a      copy before running the intrinsic
   To furthur optimize the b32->b10, b32 exponents should be generated apriori 
   and not on the fly.
   Conversion to assembly should improve b10->b32 performance.
   For b10->b32, conversion from b10^9 instead of from b10 might improve
   performance

c) Move all avx512 code to assembly -- all carry function should be done inside
   assembly.
d) b32 division -- Performance improvements.
e) Detect the lack of avx512 extensions and switch to non avx512 code at 
   runtime.
f) Expression parser -- low priority
g) Exponent -- low priority.
