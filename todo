a) The b32 vector(vec32 num) should be a vector of __m512*. This will avoid a      copy before running the intrinsic
b) To furthur optimize the b32->b10, b32 exponents should be generated apriori 
   and not on the fly.
c) Conversion to assembly should improve b10->b32 performance.

d) Move all avx512 code to assembly -- all carry function should be done inside
   assembly.
e) b32 division -- Performance improvements. Synthesize a denominator
   where the divisor occours whereever there is a 1 in the numerator.
   The synthesized denominator is then shifted right by 1.
   This step is done only once. Everything is as is after that step.
   This should reduce the number of iterations for divide_by.
f) Detect the lack of avx512 extensions and switch to non avx512 code at 
   runtime.
g) Expression parser -- low priority
h) Exponent -- low priority.
