a) The b32 vector(vec32 num) should be a vector of __m512. This will avoid a copy 
   before running the intrinsic
b) Move all avx512 code to assembly -- all carry function should be done in assembly.
c) Performance improvements b10->b32 and b32->b10
d) Detect the lack of avx512 extensions and switch to non avx512 code at runtime.
e) Expression parser -- low priority
f) Exponent -- low priority.
