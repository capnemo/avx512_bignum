a) The b32 vector(vec32 num) should be a vector of __m512. This will avoid a copy 
   before running the intrinsic
   To furthur optimize the b32->b10, b32 exponents should be generated apriori and
   not on the fly.
   Conversion to assembly should improve b10->b32 performance.

b) Prior to assembly conversion, num32 should be converted into a vector of __m512*
c) Move all avx512 code to assembly -- all carry function should be done in assembly.
d) b32 division -- Performance improvements.
e) Detect the lack of avx512 extensions and switch to non avx512 code at runtime.
f) Expression parser -- low priority
g) Exponent -- low priority.
